## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset originally contains 1000 rows and 9 columns. It includes information such as gender, age, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis phase involved gaining insights into the dataset, identifying patterns, and understanding the relationships between different variables. Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and frequency distributions were utilized to explore the data. Key findings from the analysis was that all of the columns were positively correlated though the magnitude of correlation differed greatly.

## Machine Learning Models

Multiple machine learning models were implemented to predict diabetes. The models utilized advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The models were trained using the dataset and evaluated using various evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. The best performing model was Random Forest with an average cross-validation score of 0.966.

## Results and Visualizations

The project produced insightful visualizations that depict the relationships between different factors and diabetes risk. Visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, histograms etc to aid in understanding the patterns and trends within the dataset. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables and diabetes.

## Feature Importance

The project conducted feature importance analysis to identify the key factors influencing diabetes prediction. The analysis revealed that the most important features for diabetes prediction were age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. Understanding these key features can help healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes.

## Deployment

The project is currently seeking collaboration with individuals or teams experienced in deployment to bring the diabetes prediction model into real-world applications. If you are interested in collaborating or have expertise in model deployment, please feel free to reach out and contribute.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. The original source of the dataset can be found in this repository.

## Conclusion

The diabetes prediction project successfully developed machine learning models for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on demographic and health-related factors. The models demonstrated good performance, with the best performing model achieving very high percentage of true positives and true negatives in the confusion matrix. The project provides valuable insights into diabetes risk factors and can assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and prevention of diabetes.
